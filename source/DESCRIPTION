Description: The spatial interpolation of genetic distances between
	     samples is based on a modified kriging method that
	     accepts a genetic distance matrix and generates a map of
	     probability of lineage presence. This package also offers
	     tools to generate a map of  potential contact zones
	     between groups with user-defined thresholds in the tree
	     to account for old and recent divergence. Additionally,
	     it has functions for IDW interpolation using genetic data
	     and midpoints. Details on the algorithm in Tarroso et al
		 (2015) <doi: 10.1111/1755-0998.12312> and Tarroso et al 
		 (2019) <doi: 10.1111/1755-0998.13010>.
