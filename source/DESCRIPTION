Description: The spatial interpolation of genetic distances between
	     samples is based on a modified kriging method that
	     accepts a genetic distance matrix and generates a map of
	     probability of lineage presence. This package also offers
	     tools to generate a map of  potential contact zones
	     between groups with user-defined thresholds in the tree
	     to account for old and recent divergence. Additionally,
	     it has functions for IDW interpolation using genetic data
	     and midpoints.
